## Technologies Used 

1. Tailwind CSS 
    - Tailwind CSS is a utlity-first CSS framework that provides pre-built classes you can use directly in your HTML or JSX. This saves you from needing to write custom CSS for each component, which lets you iterate faster, replicate designs easier and maintain a consistent styling. It's also desgined to be mobile-first by default but also scalable for larger screen sizes. 
2. Vite 
    - Vite is the build tool used to develop and serve this project. It's optimized for speed, simplicity and performs better than Create React App. It also works seamlessly with Tailwind.
